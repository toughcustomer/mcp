# Tough Customer MCP — User Stories

Scope: the remote MCP server at `https://mcp-umber-three.vercel.app/mcp` that lets an LLM client (Claude Desktop, claude.ai, ChatGPT Apps, mcp-ui) configure and launch a Tough Customer roleplay session.

Three audiences:

- **Admin** — wires the server into an identity provider and deploys it.
- **Operator** — ongoing day-to-day maintenance of the server, data, and integrations.
- **End user** — a salesperson using Claude to spin up a roleplay.

Each story uses `As a <role>, I want <capability>, so that <outcome>.` Acceptance criteria are concrete and testable.

## 1. Setup & deployment

### 1.1 Fork and deploy
**As an** admin, **I want** to deploy my own copy of the MCP server, **so that** I control the data, logs, and identity boundary.

Acceptance:
- Clone `https://github.com/toughcustomerai/mcp`, run `npm install`, `npm run build` — no errors.
- `npx vercel --prod` produces a `*.vercel.app` URL that responds to `POST /mcp` with a JSON-RPC manifest.
- Landing page at `/` lists the registered resources, tools, and prompts.

Status: ✅

### 1.2 Configure backend (Salesforce)
**As an** admin, **I want** to point the MCP server at Salesforce so SOQL runs as the end user with `WITH USER_MODE`, **so that** FLS + sharing rules (and admin field restrictions) are enforced by the CRM itself.

Acceptance:
- `lib/tc-service.ts` dispatches: `USE_SALESFORCE=true` → `lib/tc-salesforce.ts`, else mock.
- `lib/tc-salesforce.ts` calls Apex REST endpoints (see `APEX.md`) — not raw `/query` — so `WITH USER_MODE` is in force even for admin users.
- Five Apex classes deployed: `TCOpportunitiesApi`, `TCOpportunityContactsApi`, `TCVoicesApi`, `TCScenariosApi`, `TCSessionsApi`.
- Env vars set in Vercel: `USE_SALESFORCE`, `SF_LOGIN_URL`, `SF_API_VERSION` (optional), `MCP_PUBLIC_URL`.
- Connected App exists in SF with PKCE required, scopes `api refresh_token openid`.
- A non-admin rep testing against the MCP server only sees their own opportunities; an admin testing with a restricted profile sees only the fields that profile allows.

Status: 🟡 (scaffolding shipped; Apex classes + Connected App are manual setup in Salesforce)

### 1.3 Connect to Claude Desktop / claude.ai
**As an** end user, **I want** to add the MCP server as a connector in Claude, **so that** I can use it from any chat.

Acceptance:
- Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector → paste URL → connector appears with the expected tools/resources/prompts.
- After a successful connect, `list_opportunities`, `list_voices`, `list_scenarios`, `get_opportunity_contacts`, `create_roleplay_session`, and the `setup_sales_roleplay` prompt are all visible.
- Server changes require a connector reinstall (uninstall → quit Claude → reinstall) to refresh the cached manifest.

Status: ✅

### 1.4 MCP Inspector smoke test
**As an** admin, **I want** to verify the server with MCP Inspector, **so that** I can debug without involving Claude.

Acceptance:
- `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector` → Streamable HTTP → server URL → successfully lists tools, resources, and prompts.
- Calling each tool with valid inputs returns structured content without errors.

Status: ⬜ (works, but not documented in README)

---

## 2. Authentication & authorization

### 2.1 Trust model
**As an** admin, **I want** to understand the current trust model, **so that** I know what's enforced and by whom.

Current reality:
- In **mock mode** (default): the server returns in-memory demo data to anyone who can reach `/mcp`. No auth. Do not connect real customers.
- In **Salesforce mode** (`USE_SALESFORCE=true`): every MCP request must carry `Authorization: Bearer <sf-token>`. The server verifies the token via `/services/oauth2/userinfo` and uses that identity — `userEmail` is NOT a tool parameter and cannot be spoofed.
- All reads and writes hit Apex REST endpoints that wrap SOQL in `WITH USER_MODE`, so FLS + sharing + admin field restrictions are enforced by Salesforce.

Acceptance:
- `getSfAuth()` throws `TCUnauthorizedError` on missing/invalid tokens; tool handlers surface that to Claude.
- No tool accepts an identity claim as an input.
- Mock mode is clearly labeled on the landing page.

Status: ✅ (code in place; mock labelling pending — see 1.1)

### 2.2 OAuth 2.1 via Salesforce Connected App
**As an** admin, **I want** Salesforce to be the OAuth authorization server for the MCP server, **so that** identity and data authorization share one source of truth.

Acceptance:
- Salesforce Connected App with PKCE required, scopes `api refresh_token openid`.
- Server exposes `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (RFC 9728) pointing at the SF login URL when `USE_SALESFORCE=true`.
- Unauthenticated `POST /mcp` returns `401` with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="…"` pointing back to the metadata doc, so MCP clients auto-trigger the OAuth flow.
- Claude opens the Salesforce login flow on connect and stores the access + refresh tokens.
- Every MCP request carries `Authorization: Bearer <sf-token>`; `getSfAuth()` verifies via `/services/oauth2/userinfo`.
- Token → SfAuth cache TTL ≤ 60s so revocations propagate quickly.
- Dynamic Client Registration: enabled in SF if the edition supports it (Spring '25+); otherwise document hand-provisioning.

Status: 🟡 (protocol-level 401 + WWW-Authenticate, userinfo verification, `.well-known`, SfAuth plumbing all shipped; Connected App is manual setup in Salesforce)

### 2.3 Row-level security via Salesforce USER_MODE
**As an** admin, **I want** Salesforce itself to enforce that users only see records their profile allows, **so that** there is no second policy engine to get wrong.

Acceptance:
- Every SOQL query in the Apex REST layer (`TC*Api` classes in `APEX.md`) ends with `WITH USER_MODE`.
- A test rep with a restricted profile cannot retrieve records outside their role hierarchy via the MCP server.
- A test admin running the MCP server cannot see fields hidden by a custom FLS-restricted permission set.
- No service-account / integration-user credential is stored in the MCP server — all SF calls use the end user's token.

Status: 🟡 (MCP-side plumbing ready; Apex classes are manual deploy)

### 2.4 Workspace / domain allow-listing
**As an** admin, **I want** to restrict the MCP server to specific email domains (e.g. `@toughcustomer.ai`), **so that** only my team can connect.

Acceptance:
- Env var `MCP_ALLOWED_DOMAINS="toughcustomer.ai,partner.com"`.
- Auth middleware rejects tokens whose `email_verified=true` domain is not in the list, with a `403` and a clear error.
- Unit test covers both accept and reject cases.

Status: ⬜

### 2.5 Audit log
**As an** admin, **I want** every tool call logged with verified user identity, tool name, inputs, and result, **so that** I have a real audit trail.

Acceptance:
- Each tool call writes a row to an append-only log (Supabase `mcp_audit_log` or equivalent) with: `user_id`, `email`, `tool`, `inputs` (redacted secrets), `success`, `latency_ms`, `timestamp`.
- Failed auth attempts are logged too (with the rejected email, if extractable).
- Log retention ≥ 90 days.

Status: ⬜

### 2.6 Token revocation
**As an** admin, **I want** to revoke a user's access immediately when they leave the company, **so that** stale tokens can't be used against the MCP server.

Acceptance:
- Revoking the user in the IdP causes the next MCP call (within one refresh-token lifetime) to fail with 401.
- Short access-token lifetimes (≤ 1 hour) are configured.

Status: ⬜

## 3. End-user stories (the salesperson in Claude)

### 3.1 Guided setup via prompt
**As a** salesperson, **I want** to click "Set Up a Sales Roleplay" in Claude's prompt menu, **so that** I'm walked through the whole flow without remembering tool names.

Acceptance:
- The `setup_sales_roleplay` prompt appears under the Tough Customer connector.
- After invoking it, Claude asks for my email (today) or uses the OAuth identity (post-2.2), then lists opportunities, then contacts, then voice + scenario, then offers backstory, then creates the session.
- Claude always refers to things by name, not ID.

Status: ✅

### 3.2 Ad-hoc discovery
**As a** salesperson, **I want** to say "list my Tough Customer opportunities" in a free-form chat, **so that** I don't have to use the prompt menu.

Acceptance:
- Claude calls `list_opportunities` without additional coaching.
- If it hesitates (answers from general knowledge), a nudge like "use the Tough Customer connector" is enough.

Status: ✅ (works, occasional coaching needed)

### 3.3 Pick a deal
**As a** salesperson, **I want** to see my opportunities with stage and deal size, **so that** I can pick which one to practice.

Acceptance:
- `list_opportunities` returns id, name, stage, amount for each.
- Claude renders a table or numbered list.
- User can reply with a number, a name, or "the GlobalTech one" and Claude resolves it to the ID internally.

Status: ✅

### 3.4 Pick a contact
**As a** salesperson, **I want** to see only the contacts on the deal I picked, **so that** I roleplay against the right buyer.

Acceptance:
- `get_opportunity_contacts` returns only contacts for that opportunity.
- Contacts include name and title.
- Invalid opportunityId returns a clean `TCNotFoundError`.

Status: ✅

### 3.5 Pick voice and scenario
**As a** salesperson, **I want** to see all available voices and scenarios in one step, **so that** picking is fast.

Acceptance:
- `list_voices` returns name, gender, description for each voice.
- `list_scenarios` returns name and description.
- Claude suggests a sensible default scenario based on the deal's stage (e.g. Negotiation → Pricing Negotiation).

Status: ✅

### 3.6 Add optional backstory
**As a** salesperson, **I want** to add free-text context ("Tom just lost his CISO headcount budget"), **so that** the AI buyer behaves realistically.

Acceptance:
- `create_roleplay_session` accepts an optional `backstory` field up to 4000 chars.
- Backstory appears in the returned deal-context summary.
- Omitting backstory produces a clean session with no placeholder text.

Status: ✅

### 3.7 Launch the session
**As a** salesperson, **I want** a shareable session URL I can click to start the roleplay, **so that** I can go straight from chat to practice.

Acceptance:
- `create_roleplay_session` returns a `https://www.toughcustomer.ai/session/sess_xxx` URL.
- Claude renders it as a clickable link in its response.
- The session response includes the full deal context so Claude can prep me before I click.

Status: ✅ (URL is currently mocked)

### 3.8 Pre-call coaching
**As a** salesperson, **I want** Claude to give me 3–5 bullet points of prep based on the deal context, **so that** I'm ready when the roleplay starts.

Acceptance:
- After `create_roleplay_session` returns, Claude summarizes the buyer, scenario, and any backstory.
- Coaching bullets are concrete ("expect pushback on 'why now'") not generic.

Status: ✅ (behavior of the current prompt)

### 3.9 Errors surface cleanly
**As a** salesperson, **I want** to see a readable error if something goes wrong, **so that** I know whether to retry, pick again, or ask my admin.

Acceptance:
- `TCNotFoundError`, `TCUnauthorizedError`, and generic errors all return `isError: true` with a single `text` message prefixed `Error:`.
- Claude shows the error to me and offers the next reasonable action (pick again, re-auth, etc.).

Status: ✅

### 3.10 Session continuity across chats
**As a** salesperson, **I want** Claude to remember who I am across chats (post-OAuth), **so that** I don't get asked for my email every conversation.

Acceptance (post-2.2):
- OAuth token is stored at connector level, not chat level.
- A new chat with Tough Customer tools enabled does not prompt for identity.
- Token refresh happens silently.

Status: ⬜

## 4. Operator stories

### 4.1 Add / remove opportunities without redeploy
**As an** operator, **I want** the opportunity list to come from a live source, **so that** I don't redeploy the MCP server every time sales data changes.

Acceptance:
- `listOpportunities()` fetches from the real Tough Customer API (or Supabase).
- Cache TTL is short (≤ 60s) or explicitly bypassed.

Status: ⬜

### 4.2 Manage voices and scenarios
**As an** operator, **I want** to add new voices and scenarios without a code deploy, **so that** I can iterate on the product offering.

Acceptance:
- Voices and scenarios live in a Tough Customer admin table, not a TypeScript constant.
- A new row appears in `list_voices` / `list_scenarios` within one cache TTL.

Status: ⬜

### 4.3 Observability
**As an** operator, **I want** tool-call latency and error-rate metrics, **so that** I can catch regressions.

Acceptance:
- p50/p95 latency and error rate per tool visible in Vercel analytics or an external APM.
- Alert fires if error rate > 5% over 5 minutes.

Status: ⬜

### 4.4 Rate limiting
**As an** operator, **I want** per-user rate limits on `create_roleplay_session`, **so that** a runaway agent can't spin up thousands of sessions.

Acceptance:
- ≤ N sessions per user per hour (config via env var).
- Over-limit returns `429` with a `Retry-After` hint.

Status: ⬜

## 5. Non-goals (explicitly out of scope)

- Inline UI widgets in Claude (ui:// rawHtml resources) — Claude Desktop and claude.ai don't render them yet.
- CRM integrations (HubSpot, Salesforce) — separate connector, not this one.
- Multi-tenant data in a single deployment — each tenant should fork-and-deploy for now.
- Streaming tool responses — current responses are small enough to return whole.

---

## 6. Roadmap (by priority)

1. **OAuth 2.1 (2.2)** — unblocks everything else.
2. **Real backend in `tc-service.ts` (1.2)** — behind the auth boundary.
3. **RLS (2.3) + domain allow-listing (2.4)** — make the data boundary enforceable.
4. **Audit log (2.5) + observability (4.3)** — production readiness.
5. **Live data sources (4.1, 4.2)** — operator ergonomics.
6. **Rate limiting (4.4)** — cost control.
